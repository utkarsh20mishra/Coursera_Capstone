India is a country in South Asia. It is the second-most populous country, the seventh-largest country by land area, and the most populous democracy in the world. India is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories. With this much diversity. Indian cuisine consists of a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines. Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially from each other, using locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruit. Indian foodways have been influenced by religion, in particular Hindu cultural choices and traditions. In this project I looked for difference and similarity between all major cities in india."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### 1.2 Problem"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Using the data available is it possible to determine whether different cities have something in common?

This project is focused on India so firstly we need data of all the major cities. To collect the name and state of major cities in India [this data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_India_by_population) from Wikipedia is used\n2. Now that we have names and state of the major cities we can use geocoder to get latitude and longitude of all the cities\n3. Finally we use Foursquare to collect relevance data of all the major venues"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### 2.2 Data cleaning and Feature selection"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "After importing city data to dataframe using pandas library, firstly unnecessary columns needs to be removed so in first step of data cleaning we remove population and rank data from our data to get city name and state. This dataframe contains 319 cities so we need to limit the no. of city to 100 to get only the major cities of India. Now to use Foursqaure API to get relevence data, location of all the cities needs to be added in the dataframe. We use geocoder to get location of all cities and add this data as latitude and longitude to our dataframe. When we use geocoder we did not get location of some of the cities and this will result in error when we proceed further so this is also needs to removed. After this process we end up with 90 cities.\n\nAfter cleaning location data our dataframe will have 4 columns name, state, latitude and longitude of the city. We use Foursquare API to get top 100 major vanues of all cities. this include restaurants, bar, cafe, historic sites, parks and many other popular venues.\n\nWe use city name, venues catagory, states their location as our feature to further evalueate the similarity and other parameters between cities."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
